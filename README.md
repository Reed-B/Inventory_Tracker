# Inventory_Tracker
Java project created for proof of knowledge of Java programing and concepts.

Simple application to keep track of items by organizing them into departments. Item data can store what department it is in, the quantity of the item, and a long description of the item.

Currently you can create your own database to run the application, but the application itself holds no way of creating the tables for you.

If you would like to just run the application by itelf, the Inventory_Tracker.jar file and a 'config' that connects to a working database is all that is needed to run this application. If you require a proper config file to connect to a working database for testing purposes, please email me at rbehnf@gmail.com.
